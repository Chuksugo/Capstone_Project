1. Repository Creation
Create a new repository:

Go to your Git hosting service (GitHub).
Create a new repository and name it appropriately.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up a virtual environment:

Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.
Activate the virtual environment to start using it.
Install Django:

Install Django within the virtual environment using your package manager.
Set up Git:

Create a .gitignore file to ensure unnecessary files are not included in your repository. Include typical Django and Python-related files to exclude.

Create a new Django project:

Use the Django management command to create a new project. Ensure that the project is created in the current directory to keep your structure simple.
Verify the project structure:

Confirm that the project folder has the basic Django structure, including manage.py, a project folder with __init __.py, settings.py, urls.py, asgi.py, and wsgi.py.
Run the development server:

Start the development server to verify that the project was created successfully. Open a web browser and check that the default Django welcome page appears.

App Creation
Create a new app:

Use the Django management command to create a new app within your project directory.
Verify the app structure:

Confirm that the app folder has the standard structure, including __init __.py, admin.py, apps.py, models.py, tests.py, views.py, and a migrations folder.
Register the app in settings.py:

Open the settings.py file of your project and add your newly created app to the INSTALLED_APPS list to make it recognized by Django.
